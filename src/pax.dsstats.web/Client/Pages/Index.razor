    <h4>Rating Rules (under development)</h4>

    <p></p>

    <p>
        Player ratings serve as an indicator and do not represent a very accurate strength of a player.
    </p>

    <p>
        Player rating can change drastically if another player uploads all of their replays. This player rating will be adjusted, as well as all ratings of players with/against this player.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you lose against a very strong team, you lose very few rating points, but if you win, you gain a lot. Because of this, there's no reason to leave a lobby, and shuffling players could backfire.
        <i>"You never lose. You either win or you learn."</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        Leavers (a player who leaves the game without pressing the Victory/Defeate button) receive a penalty in their rating. (Maybe check if the team left at some point to process inhouse defeats)
    </p>

    <p>
        Players who do not upload a lost replay, but that replay is uploaded by one or more other players in the game will receive a penalty in their rating.
